# Pickture 
Pickture is a web extension used to search similar clothes from images on the internet. The extension answers with clothes similars to the ones on the picture but from Inditex brands, allowing you to go directly to the product with just one click, or save it for later. Besides, you can also look for clothes just by typing what are you looking for in case you can not found what you were looking for.
All this thanks to the [Inditex Tech Open Source APIs](https://developer.inditex.com).
